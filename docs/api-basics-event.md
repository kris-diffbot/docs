This tutorial will show you how to use the Events API (BETA). The Diffbot Events API (BETA) is designed to facilitate the extraction of online and in-person event data for individual events that occur within a single day. Support for multi-day, multi-track events, i.e. full conference schedules and festivals, is planned for a future release.

The BETA program enables you to extract data for 
- an in-person or online meetup (in Lake Tahoe or another location, e.g. https://www.meetup.com/BAS-G1Outdoors/events/271921536/)
- an online networking event or recorded webinar (e.g. https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/relit-2020-bring-your-brave-tickets-109259768910)
- or a live streamed event (e.g. https://www.cnbcevents.com/smallbusinessplaybook/)

To try out the API directly, insert your token into one or more of these API calls:
- http://api.diffbot.com/v3/event?token=YOURTOKEN&url=https://www.meetup.com/BAS-G1Outdoors/events/271921536/
- http://api.diffbot.com/v3/event?token=YOURTOKEN&url=https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/relit-2020-bring-your-brave-tickets-109259768910
- http://api.diffbot.com/v3/event?token=YOURTOKEN&url=https://www.cnbcevents.com/smallbusinessplaybook/

or you can use the Analyze API.
