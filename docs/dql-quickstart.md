[Diffbot's Knowledge Graph (DKG)](https://www.diffbot.com/products/knowledge-graph/) allows you to search the world's largest, most accurate database of companies, articles, people, places, and other entities. To access the Knowledge Graph you will either need to call the API directly or login to the Diffbot Developer Dashboard to use the web app.

Before you get started, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- The KnowledgeGraph is rebuilt every 4-5 days. It is not a data archive, nor was it designed to support “as-was”, time-based comparisons. If you are interested in the historical context that is contained within the DKG, e.g. an individual's employment history, please let us know. We would be happy to help you craft the best approach to accessing historical data.
- In spite of not being an archive, you will occasionally want to bound some responses using the isCurrent operator, such as when you request to see an [Organization’s current employees broken out by gender](https://app.diffbot.com/search/?query=type%3APerson+employments.%7BisCurrent%3Atrue+employer.name%3A%22Facebook%22%7D+facet%3Agender&from=0&size=50&active_tab=query).
- You will be tempted to insert Boolean operators, i.e. AND, OR, etc. Don’t do it! We use a query language similar to SQL to search entities and facts contained within the graph called the Diffbot Query Language (DQL), but we do not support boolean operators as you know and love them.
- You will be searching one data type at a time, e.g. Organizations vs. Articles. You cannot query, constrain, or facet across data types.
- As you become more familiar with the KG, you might want to leverage a Diffbot unique identifier to constrain your search to a specific entity id vs. all of the text matches on the name of that entity, for example, [all articles tagged Walmart](https://app.diffbot.com/search/?query=type%3AArticle+tags.uri%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fdiffbot.com%2Fentity%2FCbb6m73dsMIKecUn0QRHosw%22+sortBy%3Adate&from=0&size=50&active_tab=query).

We’ve assembled some canned searches to help get you started. There is also a [query building tool](https://app.diffbot.com/search/) in the [Developer Dashboard](tutorials-new-dashboard) you can leverage if you get stuck.
